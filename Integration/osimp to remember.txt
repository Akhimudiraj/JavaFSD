local storage    vs 		session storage

Feature					localStorage													sessionStorage

Lifetime				Data persists until explicitly cleared		  					Data exists only for the current browser session

Scope		Shared across all tabs/windows of the same origin								Limited to one tab/window

Storage Limit			~5–10 MB (browser-dependent)												~5 MB

Survives Browser Restart?				✅ Yes														❌ No

Accessed By					Same-origin pages											Same-origin pages in same tab

Cleared When			Manually via code or browser settings									When the tab/window is closed

Race conditions

A race condition occurs when multiple threads access shared data simultaneously, and the final result depends on the timing of thread execution.

🔹 Why it’s dangerous?

Produces unpredictable results
Hard to debug
Causes data inconsistency

How to prevent?

synchronized
Locks
Atomic variables
Semaphores

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🔹 Semaphore
✅ What is it?

A semaphore is a thread synchronization mechanism that controls access to a limited number of resources.

🔹 Types

Binary Semaphore → allows 1 thread (like a lock)
Counting Semaphore → allows N threads

🔹 Example
Semaphore semaphore = new Semaphore(2); // only 2 threads allowed
🔹 Real-world analogy
🅿️ Parking lot with limited slots

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🔹 Deadlock
✅ What is it?

A deadlock occurs when two or more threads wait indefinitely for resources held by each other.

🔹 Conditions for Deadlock (Coffman Conditions)

Mutual exclusion

Hold and wait

No preemption

Circular wait

How to prevent?

Avoid nested locks
Use lock ordering
Use tryLock()
Timeout mechanisms

✅ What is Gradle?

Gradle is a build automation tool used to:

Compile code
Manage dependencies
Run tests
Package applications

🔹 Why Gradle?

Faster than Maven (incremental builds)

Uses Groovy / Kotlin DSL

Highly flexible

Widely used with Spring Boot & Android

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maven is a build automation and dependency management tool primarily used for Java projects. It follows the principle of “Convention over Configuration.”

🔹 Why Maven is Used

Automates build, test, and packaging
Manages project dependencies
Ensures standard project structure
Makes builds repeatable and consistent

mvn clean → removes old build files
mvn compile → compiles source code
mvn test → runs unit tests
mvn package → creates JAR/WAR
mvn install → installs artifact to local repo
