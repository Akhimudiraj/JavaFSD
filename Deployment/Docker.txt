Docker = A tool to package, ship, and run applications in isolated environments called containers.

Docker is a platform that allows you to package an application along with everything it needs—code, libraries, settings—into a single unit called a container.

Think of a container like a box that includes:

✔ Your application
✔ All required software (Java, Python, Node, etc.)
✔ All dependencies
✔ Configurations

Because everything is packed into this container, the application will run exactly the same on any machine.

What is a Docker Image?

A Docker Image is a blueprint (or template) for creating containers.
Think of it like:
A class in Java
A recipe in cooking
A blueprint for building a house

It contains:

✔ Your application code
✔ Required libraries
✔ Dependencies
✔ Environment settings
✔ Startup instructions

Images are read-only.
You cannot change an image after it is created.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is a Docker Container?

A Docker Container is a running instance of an image.

If the image is a recipe...
👉 The container is the final cooked dish.

If the image is a Java class...
👉 The container is the object created using new.

If the image is a blueprint...
👉 The container is the actual building.

A container:

✔ Is created from an image
✔ Runs your application
✔ Has its own isolated environment
✔ Can start, stop, restart, delete

Concept	   		Meaning				Easy Reminder
Docker Image		Blueprint / Recipe		You build it
Docker Container	Running application		You run it

In docker.jar file helps to send the code to container 

create sts and setup everything for docker.....

after inserting in docker 
to test we have to move to dockerhub  that possibe to test in another laptop

<<<<<<Laptop A>>>>
to push to universal so anyone can download 
docker tag myimage karanamharish18/myimage:latest
docker push karanamharish18/myimage:latest

<<<<<<Laptop B>>>>
 docker pull karanamharish18/myimage:latest

docker run -p 8080:8080 karanamharish18/myimage:latest

http://localhost:8080/getData
