DevOps is a combination of Development (Dev) and Operations (Ops).
It is a culture, set of practices, and tools that help organizations deliver software faster, more reliably, and with higher quality.

we use devops for faster delievery

DevOps Lifecycle Stages:

Plan – Track work using tools like Jira, Azure Boards
Code – Developers write code
Build – Code compiled (Maven, Gradle)
Test – Automated tests run (JUnit, Selenium)
Release – Automated release systems
Deploy – Deploy to server or cloud
Operate – Monitoring apps
Monitor – Track performance & logs

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dev+tester+oper works together  to make project faster 

developer-test-pre prod- releases 

example where the do 
https://facebook.com (end client)
http://devfacebook.com(devside)
http://testfacebook.com(testerside)
http://prodfacebook.com(produside)

these are done by aws, azure, google cloud platform

all these we call cloud technology
 this track we call development track

dev : jdk,eclipse,vs code,postman,sts....

JENKINS
according to client we havae to update or add new features  so this take long process for manually so that y we use an automation tool 
that tool is JENKINS so it does ci cd pipelines (automated or monitor or build)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Docker
if one person developed with one version(windows, mac,lnux) and another person doing in another version like (windows, mac, linux)
so for this reason we use DOCKER (whatever u developed i will zip it ) if u unzipped in linux it work or windows or android
zip is nothing but containirizer 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
DEvops tools

GIt/scm (source code )
docke/kubernets (verion zip)
jinikins/bamboo (jenkins automatic doing )

the data will be stored in cloud so data scientist manage the data
dont no tody 10gb, tomorrow 100g so he will manage
store the data in dataware house 
these required more cool so mostly they build in underwater
