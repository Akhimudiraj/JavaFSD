Project 3 is a secure loan pricing and approval system where RMs submit loan requests, the system calculates interest, and admins finalize approvals and sensitive details.

RM enters draft → runs interest calculation → submits

Admin reviews → approves ₹9 Cr at 11% interest → loan status = APPROVED
