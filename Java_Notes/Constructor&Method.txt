Constructor in Java
November 12th, 2022
The purpose of Constructor is just to assign values to the instance variable at the time of object creation.
Constructor gets invoked at the time of object creation.
Constructor look like a method without return type.

Rules for Creating a Constructor
1) A constructor does not have return type.
2) The name of the constructor is same as the name of the class.
3) A constructor cannot be abstract, final, static and Synchronized.

Types of Constructor
1.Default Constructor
2.Parametrized Constructor

Default Constructor
Default constructor is used to assign default values to instance data variables when there is no parametrized as well as values not assigned to instance variables.
Default constructor works automatically if it could not find a parametrized constructor in a program and there is no values assigned for instance variables.
A constructor is called “Default Constructor” when it doesn’t have any parameter.
Purpose : The default constructor is used to provide the default values to the object like 0, null, etc., depending on the type.

Example Program For Default Constructor

//Java Program to create and call a default constructor  
class Bike1{  
//creating a default constructor  
Bike1(){System.out.println(“Bike is created”);}  
//main method  
public static void main(String args[]){  
//calling a default constructor  
Bike1 b=new Bike1();  
}  
}  
Parametrized Constructor
Parametrized Constructor is to assign values to instance data variables passed during object creation.

Example Program for Parametrized Constructor
//Java Program to demonstrate the use of the parameterized constructor 
class Student{  
    int id;  
    String name;  
    //creating a parameterized constructor  
    Student(int i,String n){  
    id = i;  
    name = n;  
    }  
    //method to display the values  
    void display() { 
   System.out.println(id+” “+name); } 
    public static void main(String args[]) {  
    //creating objects and passing values  
    Student s1 = new Student(111,”Karan”);  
    Student s2 = new Student(222,”Aryan”);  
    //calling method to display the values of object  
    s1.display();  
    s2.display();  
   }  
}  
Why no return type for constructor ?
Constructor is just an intermediate between values and instance data variables, it makes use of local variables to pass on / assign values so there is no need to return anything as output.
Why Constructor has same name as class name ?
Constructor call has to identify the instance variable present inside the class with the help of ClassName so constructor should be same as ClassName for easy identification.
What is the purpose of Constructor ?
The purpose of constructor is to assign values to the instance variables at the time of object creation.
Can Constructor can be Overloaded ?
Yes, Constructor can be overloaded.
Can Overriding happens in Constructor ?
No, it ends in compiler error because two class can not have same name.
Who Writes default Constructor ?
Javac
Who runs default Constructor ?
JVM
