layers 5

My controller >>>> presentation layer frontend interacts with backend it handles the request 

service layer >> service btw controller and repo contains business logics like calculations, validations,rules

persistence layer >>(repository layer) interact with database talks to db like saveall findall delete

Database layer >> application.propertes  MySQL,oracle

framework layer >>heat of application


user send a req 
controller calls repository (service)
repository use db
db saves/fetches data





⚙️ Benefits of the Service Layer

✅ Keeps code clean and modular
✅ Separates business logic from controller logic
✅ Makes testing easier (you can test service independently)
✅ Allows reuse of logic (e.g., background jobs, schedulers, or other APIs)
✅ Follows SOLID principles and layered architecture

spring security
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/advance-java/introduction-to-spring-security-and-its-features/

Spring Security is a powerful and highly customizable authentication and access-control framework for Java applications, primarily used with Spring Boot. Its main goal is to secure applications by handling:

Authentication – verifying who the user is.

Authorization – deciding what the user is allowed to do.

Protection against attacks like CSRF, CORS misconfig, session fixation, password encoding, etc.

===========
Authentication

Supports:

In-memory users

JDBC authentication

JPA authentication

LDAP

OAuth2 / JWT
===================================

✔️ Authorization

Method-level security: @PreAuthorize, @PostAuthorize

URL-based security rules

===========================
✔️ Security Filters

Uses a chain of filters like:

UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter

BasicAuthenticationFilter

BearerTokenAuthenticationFilter
=========================
✔️ Attack Protection

CSRF protection

CORS configuration

Password hashing using BCrypt

Session management
==============================
1 add dependencies , create security config file use annotations in security file 
@enablewebsecurity
@configuration

==================================
Spring Boot 3+ JWT Security (Complete Guide)
jwt (json wb token)

1. What is JWT?

JWT (JSON Web Token) is a secure, compact token used to represent user identity.
It is commonly used for stateless authentication in modern web apps.

A JWT contains 3 parts:

Header – algorithm & token type
Payload – user info (e.g., username, roles)
Signature – verifies that the token is not tampered with

1 add dependencies, 
2 create jwt utility class(handles token creation+ validations ) 
3 create jwt authentication filter(extracts the tokens and set auntentication)
4 security configuration file

{User logs in → server returns JWT
User sends JWT in every request
Spring Security validates token → user becomes authenticated
No server session is required (stateless) }

=============================================

JWT Authentication — Simple Explanation (Like a Story)

Imagine you want to enter a secure building (your application).

⭐ Step 1: User knocks on the door

You send username & password to /login.

Meaning:
You are asking the server → “Please let me in.”

⭐ Step 2: Security guard checks your ID

Spring Security checks:

Is the username correct?

Is the password correct?

Meaning:
Server verifies your identity.

⭐ Step 3: Guard gives you a badge (JWT Token)

If you're valid, the server gives you a token.

This token has:

Your name

Your role (USER/ADMIN)

Expiry time

A signature so it cannot be copied

Meaning:
Token = Entry pass.

⭐ Step 4: You keep the badge

You store the token on your side (browser or mobile).

Important:
The server does NOT keep any record of the token → That’s why it's called stateless.

⭐ Step 5: Every time you enter a new room, you show the badge

When you call any API:

GET /products
Authorization: Bearer <token>


Meaning:
You show your badge to enter another room.

⭐ Step 6: A scanner checks your badge (JWT Filter)

Before entering the room, a machine (filter) checks:

Is your token still valid?

Is the signature correct?

Has it expired?

Does your role allow entry?

Meaning:
Spring Security checks the token BEFORE processing your request.

⭐ Step 7: If badge is valid → you get access

After verification:

Spring marks you as authenticated

You can now access the endpoint

Meaning:
You’re allowed to do what your role permits.

⭐ Step 8: If badge is invalid → Access denied

If token is:

expired

fake

tampered

missing

Then Spring Security returns:

401 Unauthorized

🎯 ONE-LINE SUMMARY

Login → Get token → Send token on every request → Filter checks token → Access granted.

=============================================

It’s widely used for web applications, REST APIs, and microservices.

springboot actuator

What is Spring Boot Actuator?

Spring Boot Actuator is a feature that helps you monitor, manage, and check the health of your Spring Boot application.

It gives you many useful ready-made endpoints like:

✔ Health check

✔ App info

✔ Metrics (CPU, memory, requests)

✔ Environment details

✔ Beans

✔ Logging

✔ Thread info

You don’t have to write code — Actuator gives it automatically.
